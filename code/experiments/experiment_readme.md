# Experiments 

## Experiment 1: 

- causal structures: AND, OR
- outcome: positive 	
- counterbalancing: 
	+ whether ball A or B is more likely to go through the motion block 
	+ which ball is at the top or bottom 

## Experiment 2: 

- causal structures: AND, OR
- outcome: negative 
- counterbalancing: 
	+ whether ball A or B is more likely to go through the motion block 
	+ which ball is at the top or bottom 

## Experiment 3: 

- causal structures: XOR
- outcome: positive 
- counterbalancing: 
	+ whether ball A or B is more likely to go through the motion block 
	+ which ball is at the top or bottom 

## Experiment 4: 

- causal structures: XOR
- outcome: negative 
- counterbalancing: 
	+ whether ball A or B is more likely to go through the motion block 
	+ which ball is at the top or bottom
